# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide

Complete guide to push your Arabic Voice Assistant to GitHub.

## 🎯 Quick Setup (Automated)

### Option 1: Using the Setup Script
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./setup_github.sh
```

This script will:
- Check if GitHub CLI is installed
- Create a private repository
- Push your code to GitHub
- Provide you with the repository URL

## 🔧 Manual Setup

### Step 1: Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gh

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

### Step 2: Login to GitHub
```bash
gh auth login
```

### Step 3: Create Private Repository
```bash
# Create private repository
gh repo create arabic-voice-assistant \
    --private \
    --description "Complete Arabic voice assistant for office use with memory, task management, and natural language processing" \
    --add-readme=false
```

### Step 4: Add Remote and Push
```bash
# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arabic-voice-assistant.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

2. Click "New repository"
3. Repository name: `arabic-voice-assistant`
4. Description: `Complete Arabic voice assistant for office use with memory, task management, and natural language processing`

7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
